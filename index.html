<p style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;">I come from a small island nation named Samoa. We still use a traditional chief system that runs under the Samoan government. Furthermore, everyone was taught for an early age “fa’a Samoa,” which translates to “the Samoan way.” I recently graduated in 2020 from Corinda State High while speaking two languages, Samoan and English. I used to play for competitive teams under Melbourne storms including my own country. I later, unfortunately, dropped rugby due to Covid-19 restrictions that impacted our seasons schedule.

<h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Interest In IT</h2>
<p style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;">Technology is advancing at an astonishing pace improving life as we know it. Wherever you look technology is involved. As someone who likes to understand the process and history of something's creation, it would be impossible to overlook IT. Playing on my pc and fiddling with my pc's components in hopes of troubleshooting an issue, have piqued my interest in pc building and components. I've decided to take this course in the sense of possibly having a career change. One main matter that interests me in the field of IT is its infinite possibilities of advancement. IT is the core of human continuation. </p>

<p style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;">The year 2020 was the year I graduated from high school. I originally planned to begin my studies the following year but with the seriousness of Covid-19 financial problems began to rise and my plans were delayed. During the lockdown period, social media was my best friend, and exploring the internet became my main source of entertainment. It was during this time that I purchased and explored my very first pc, taking apart and getting to know more about the components main roles and how everything ties together. Learning while troubleshooting issues that appear here and there have inspired me to further my study with IT. Whilst working casual with full-time hours, Online RMIT was the best choice as Its flexible time schedule benefits me greatly. </p>

<p style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;">As a novice with only basic knowledge, I chose to study this subject to build a solid foundation in contemporary Information Technology areas, software, applications and job skills required to enter the IT market. With a well-built foundation, I hope to successfully describe and apply basic concepts of contemporary technologies, participate effectively and creatively in a team environment, and analyse the human and social contexts of technological innovations. </p>

<p style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;"> As a fledgeling within this workforce, my knowledge amounts to only using basic tools such as HMTL, CSS, GitHub, and a little of Notepad++. Despite using these useful tools my knowledge on them is awfully low.  </p>

<p style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;">While my current skills and knowledge may stray far from the essential requirements for this position, having a clear path in which I obtain them is needed. Such a path would include continuing this unit and further continuing studies within Bachelor of IT, find employment within an IT related workplace for experience, etc, and self-study using credible online educational materials/ resources.

<p style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;">My learning style was exactly what I expected as I prefer visual learning. I Find visual learning much more memorable than any other learning style, as if taking a picture of what I’ve seen and storing it within my memories, just like a camera. With group projects, coming up with unique ideas is a must, ensuring individuality amongst the many other ideas from other groups. Without creativity, humanity wouldn’t have come so far. When forming a group for a project, creativity is required in order for different ideas to flow around, allowing for better collaboration.  </p>

<h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Project Idea</h2>

<h3 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Overview</h3>
<p style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;">For my project proposal, I'm currently aiming for something that will, in my opinion, considerably improve the ease of travelling to new places, an everyday app that will make life easier. An application that, upon entering the suburb/ location, sends pertinent information about the area, such as weather, events, shop offers, announcements, and fuel prices, directly to the user's mobile phone. This application would also collect data about the area's history, such as crime statistics. Although there are other applications that display weather data, there aren't many that provide significantly greater detail over a greater amount of content. </p>

<p style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;">Of course, it won’t be limited to only entering the area, you also have the option to type the locations name within the search bar, providing you with everything related with the area. Overall, saving you time going through different sources for a particular fact. </p>

<h3 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Motivation</h3>
<p style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;">Consider the following scenario: you decide to relocate due to unforeseen circumstances, and you're unfamiliar with the area, so you decide to use the app. It informs you the nearest shopping centre with sales, the nearest petrol station with pricing, the current weather, and much more. This would make it so much easier for you to travel around.  </p>

<p style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;">I find this proposal to be useful in many cases, which would almost no doubt become an everyday app. It does the information gathering for the user, saving time and stress searching for one specific thing. Moving houses is almost always stressful, and according to sources, ‘more renters in our study tended to find moving to be stressful (84%), compared to owners of property (78%)’ (Budget Direct 2021, section. 2.6). In my opinion, I see this app having potential to be extremely useful for people who are thinking of or moving houses.  </p>
